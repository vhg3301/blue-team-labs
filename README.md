# Blue Team Labs — Defensive Security Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains my **Blue Team labs**, focusing on defensive security, incident analysis, and threat awareness.

The goal of this project is to document real-world security scenarios and demonstrate practical skills such as:

- Email threat analysis (phishing, spoofing, social engineering)
- IOC identification and documentation
- Defensive mindset and security reporting
- Basic incident response reasoning
- Security awareness + safe investigation practices

## About This Repository

This repo is structured as a collection of **mini projects**, each one representing a lab or case study.

Each lab contains:

- A written report (`README.md` or `report.md`)
- Evidence (screenshots)
- Key indicators and takeaways
- Defensive recommendations
