# Blue Team Labs — Defensive Security Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is my **Blue Team lab portfolio**, focused on **defensive security**, threat detection, and investigation workflows.

The objective is to document realistic security labs in a structured way — similar to how a SOC analyst would write internal reports.

---

## Goals

This repository is designed to demonstrate practical skills in:

- Incident analysis and triage
- Log analysis and security monitoring
- IOC identification and reporting
- Phishing and email threat analysis
- SIEM workflows (ex: Wazuh)
- Documentation and communication (SOC-style)

---

## How This Repository Works

This repo is a **container** for multiple labs.

Each lab has its own folder and its own `README.md`, containing:

- The scenario / sample
- The analysis
- Evidence (screenshots, logs, etc)
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Recommendations and mitigations
- Lessons learned

---

## Tools & Topics

Labs in this repository may include:

* Linux security analysis
* Email header and phishing investigation
* Wazuh (SIEM / EDR)
* Authentication anomaly detection
* Windows/Linux log review
* Custom scripts (Python / Bash)

---

## Status

This repository is continuously updated with new labs.

Each new folder represents a new case study.

---

## Disclaimer

This repository is for **educational and defensive purposes only**.

No malware, credential harvesting, payloads, or offensive instructions are included.
